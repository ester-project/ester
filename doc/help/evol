Calculate a pseudo-evolution. 

At this moment this evolution is calculated just varying Xc while maintaining 
constant M and Lz. This behaviour is provisional and will change in future 
versions.

To use it we must specify an input model (using -i or -input_file) calculated
using ester 1d or ester 2d:

         ester evol -i input_model

Other valid parameters are:

   -dXc : decrement in Xc (default: 0.05)

   -Xcmin : minimum value of Xc (default: 0.05)

   -o outfile : The default is outfile=input_file

and other parameters inherited from ester 2d (-verbose, ...).
However, it is not possible to change model parameters with ester evol (as mass,
resolution, etc.).
The output is a series of files output_XXXX, where XXXX is an index number,
containing the models at different stages.
