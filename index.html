                <h1>Project Description</h1>
                The ambition of this project is to set out a two-dimensional
                stellar evolution code, which fully takes into account the
                effects of rotation, at any rate and in a self-consistent way.

                The difficult, but important point is that rotating stars are
                spheroidal and are never in hydrostatic equilibrium. They are
                pervaded by flows everywhere, even in the stably stratified
                radiative regions. These flows are essentially convective flows
                in thermally unstable regions (convection zones) and baroclinic
                flows in the radiative regions. These latter flows are grosso
                modo a differential rotation and a meridional circulation, with
                likely some small-scale turbulence. Radiative regions of
                non-rotating stars experience very little mixing (only due to
                microscopic phenomena).  Rotation induces flows and therefore
                some mixing, well-known as "rotational mixing". This is a key
                feature of the evolution of rotating stars. Besides, these stars
                also oscillate, and astronomers would like to get from the
                oscillation frequencies some good constraints on the structure
                of these stars. The foregoing reasons and many others motivated
                us to construct a two-dimensional model of rotating stars that
                is kind enough to enlight us on the numerous questions we are
                wondering about...
